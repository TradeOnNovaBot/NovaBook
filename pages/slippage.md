Source: https://docs.tradeonnova.io/configuration/settings/slippage

Slippage is how many less tokens you're willing to receive in any given transaction. This means if optimised, your transaction is more likely to go through.

## What slippage should I set?

Your slippage depends on the volatility of the token. 

We recommend a value between 50-80% for tokens trending, and lower for stable tokens.
