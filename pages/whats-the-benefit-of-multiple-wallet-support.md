## What's the benefit of Multiple Wallet Support?

You can trade and view performance of your tokens with more than just one wallet, which allows for **better risk management, and faster trading decisions minimising the time needed to switch between wallets.** 

You can set one wallet as the `**Default**`wallet which will be used primarily to execute trades and switch interchangeably between the other wallets as you please.
